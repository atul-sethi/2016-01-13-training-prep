My name is Christof De Bo and I'm a Research Informatics Scientist at VIB, a Life Sciences Research institute in Belgium. My daily tasks are software training and support for lab technicians, PhD students and post-docs. Me and my colleagues provide bioinformatics services to all scientist at our institute (about 1300 people). In the future, I want to focus my job on training of lab related software and bioinformatics skills to our scientists.
